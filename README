Route Plot Plugin for OpenCPN by Walbert Schulpen (SaltyPaws)
=============================================================

The purpose of Route additional Great Circle, Limited Circle and Rhumb line plotting capability to OpenCPN. 

While the easiest way to get from A to B is by plotting a constant heading course (Rhumb Line), the shortest possible way is by sailing a constant arc (Great Circle). This is due to the curvature of the earth, and the way this is applied in Mercator projections. This Great Circle could take you into the high or low latitudes, which most sailors prefer to avoid due to icebergs and/or severe weather. When using the Limited circle option you can enter the most southern/northern latitude you are comfortable navigating, and the limited circle route will keep you on that latitude.

The easiest way to import way points is with the right click menu anywhere on the map ("Start/Finish Route Here").

The Decimal degree is the most flexible input window, and will accept all common formats (dms, d m.mm and d .dddddd) as long as the coordinates are formatted properly. (e.g 10.999 or 10 59.99N or 10 59 59N. Use the paste button to paste coordinate pairs (separated by <tab> or comma). When importing decimal degree way point pairs the coordinates can be separated by just a space. If you want to paste the individual coordinates, just paste them directly in the appropriate window.

Changelog
=========
Changes to 1.2:
- Update to new build system
- Remove error message on cancelled save (FS#1069)
- Fix doubled ".gpx" file extension (FS#1070).
- Fix typos (FS#1071)
- Fix bug where GCL did not produce GPX if limit was not met FS#2020
- GCL distance is now respected in all segments (FS#1068)
- When entering waypoint in degree, minute and second format fractions can now be used (FS#1075)
- Pasting of coordinate pairs now implemented FS#1131-1
- Use the same naming convention for waypoints of limited-circle routes as for great-circle and rhumb-line routes FS#1131-2
- Waypoint distance has been added to start, finish and intermediate points
- When finish or intermediate point is within 25% of last waypoint distance, the previous point is omitted to prevent very close spaced waypoints FS#1131-3(first)
- Direct export of route to OpenCPN 
- degree minute second, when this tab is open and when calculate or export is pressed, execute convert function first. Change to decimal tab.
- Input in coordinates is now much more flexible.
- Added right click options Start and finish route here
- enable copy paste all coordinate formats (D MM.MM and DMS) from OpenCPN, message with how conversion was done.
- Vincente function replaced with the one from OpenCPN for consistency and to remove apace licence mention.



Editing
=========
Layout of the forms is edited with wxFormbuilder (file Route_pi.fbp). Be sure to run degreefix.sh after, so prevent a windows compilation error.
(Ubuntu/Linux) if the repository version is not recent enough, use this to intall the latest version of wxFormbuilder:
	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:wxformbuilder/release
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install wxformbuilder
After making an edit with the formbuilder, use the degree_fix.sh bash file to ensure windows compilation goes without a hitch.


Editing of the source can be done with Code::Blocks IDE (file Route_pi.cbp)



Compiling
=========
This plugin can now be compiled as stand alone from a build folder in route_pi:
* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ../
* make
* sudo make install


For reference, the old method (still works) is shown below.


You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual

* go to the plugin subdirectory in your OpenCPN source tree
* git clone https://github.com/SaltyPaws/route_pi.git

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ../
* make
* sudo make install
