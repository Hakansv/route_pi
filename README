Route Plot Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================

The purpose of this plugin is to provide Great Circle, Limited Circle and Rhumb line plotting capability to OpenCPN. The plugin adds functionality over the existing route plotting capability (ie, you can change the distance of the way-points, plot limited circles, and compare distances).

The aims are to:

1. Generate GPX files for Great Circle, Limited Circle and Rhumb line route plotting methods.
2. Calculate route distance using above methods.


Changelog
=========
Changes to 1.1:
- Update to new build system
- Remove error message on cancelled save (FS#1069)
- Fix doubled ".gpx" file extension (FS#1070).
- Fix typos (FS#1071)
- Fix bug where GCL did not produce GPX if limit was not met FS#2020
- GCL distance is now respected in all segments (FS#1068)
- When entering waypoint in degree, minute and second format fractions can now be used (FS#1075)
- Pasting of coordinate pairs now implemented FS#1131-1
- Use the same naming convention for waypoints of limited-circle routes as for great-circle and rhumb-line routes FS#1131-2




Editing
=========
Layout of the forms is edited with wxFormbuilder (file Route_pi.fbp). Be sure to run degreefix.sh after, so prevent a windows compilation error.
(Ubuntu/Linux) if the repository version is not recent enough, use this to intall the latest version of wxFormbuilder:
	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:wxformbuilder/release
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install wxformbuilder


Editing of the source can be done with Code::Blocks IDE (file Route_pi.cbp)



Compiling
=========
You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual

* go to the plugin subdirectory in your OpenCPN source tree
* git clone https://github.com/SaltyPaws/route_pi.git

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ../
* make
* sudo make install

ToDo
=======
Once the Navobject becomes available to the plugin API, will update to also enable direct route plotting.
